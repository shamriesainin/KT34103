    "        1. Breadth First Search\n",
    "        2. Depth First Search\n",
    "        3. Depth Limited Search\n",
    "        4. Iterative Deepening Search\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Informed search algorithms**: These type of algorithms leverage any information (heuristics, path cost) on the problem to search through the search space to find the solution efficiently.\n",
